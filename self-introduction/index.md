Hi, my name is Ilya, I'm 28 years old, I'm from Yaroslavl.

My video will not be as active as others and now I'll tell you why. I want to tell a story about me and my motivation.

My job is related to IT, but not to development, I work in computer wholesale.

Around February 2022, I started studying frontend. I worked, studied, wanted more time to study, but work didn't allow as much time as I want. I planned to quit, but because of the events in the country, I didn't quit, because my organization in IT, and I had a great idea.

Back in 2010, while playing football, I got injured, ruptured knee ligaments, had knee surgery, but after that knee problems continued, the surgery wasnâ€™t effective.

In September 2023, I went to the doctor, they found that I have a total rupture of knee ligaments, and I needed surgery. At the end of the year, I got on the waiting list for surgery.

Also in September, I heard from a friend who started his career at EPAM about Rolling Scopes school, but I'm already late for the stage 1, and I continued learning new things on my own.

Next, I started studying framework React, and before entering the course, I started making a React single page application, application for learning English, with a dictionary and a test to knowledge checks.

In the application user must select a textbook and modules, choose what he wants to see a dictionary or take a test. The dictionary includes a list of words with translation and transcription, user can hide words with transcription or translations of words, user can hear the pronunciation of the word.

A month after the start of the course, I was assigned an surgery.

And now I'm on sick leave at home, I get a salary and I have a lot of free time to study. Recovery is not fast, up to 6 months, I expect to become a normal developer during this time.

The course is very interesting and useful, sometimes the tasks seem difficult, but you just need to start doing it and you will learn a lot of new things.

I should to take this course and React course and get a job as a developer, to do what I like and develop in the right direction.

Thanks for watching, good luck!
